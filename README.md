Internal Energy Change Calculation for Thermodynamic Systems Final Report with embedded C/C# code for Ardunio IDE.

Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat and temperature, and their relation
to energy, work, radiation, and properties of matter. Historically, thermodynamics developed out of
a desire to increase the efficiency of early steam engines.
Statistical thermodynamics, or statistical mechanics, concerns itself with statistical predictions of the
collective motion of particles from their microscopic behavior. Chemical thermodynamics is the
study of the interrelation of energy with chemical reactions or with a physical change of state within
the confines of the laws of thermodynamics.
The internal energy of a system is the total energy contained within the system. It is the energy
necessary to create or prepare the system in any given state, but does not include the kinetic
energy of motion of the system as a whole, nor the potential energy of the system as a whole due to
external force fields which includes the energy of displacement of the system's surroundings.
Thus, this project deals with implementing the laws of physics and thermodynamics to study the
interaction of fluid with external surroundings. The data has been found experimentally using
Arduino micro-processer. The data gathered by the sensor is displayed in the laptop and compared
with standardized theoretical data.
The project uses embedded C/C# to code the microprocessor in order to calculate the internal energy. A reference
to the LM35 sensor table has also been made.
